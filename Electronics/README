The files in this directory called frankShield.sch and frankshield.brd are the Eagle schematic and PCB layout for the Adruino shield for Frank the Robot.

They are intended to go with an EPS8266 D1 Arduino-pinout WiFi controller, which operates at 3V3. On no account use it with any board operating at 5V.

The directory Data-sheets contains .PDF files for some of the components used.

The directory Legacy-files contains previous designs and experiments.

The file pcbtrain.dru contains the Eagle design-rules file from http://optics.eee.nottingham.ac.uk/eagle/eagle2pcbtrain.html

The file frank-gerb274x.cam is the Eagle job that generates the GERBER files for the PCB.

The file clean is a short shell script that removes the Eagle temporary files.

The GERBER files for the board are in the CAM directory.  They have the subscripts:

.GTL - top copper
.GBL - bottom copper
.GTO - top silkscreen
.GTP - top paste
.GBO - bottom silkscreen (this is not needed)
.GTS - top soldermask
.GBS - bottom soldermask
.TXT - drill file
.dri - drill specifications
.GML - Mill layer (this is not needed)
